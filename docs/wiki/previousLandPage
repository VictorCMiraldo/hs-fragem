Welcome to the hs-fragem wiki!

Fragem provides a domain specific language (DSL) to analyse and calculate the fractal dimension of music!


# Quick Start

Installation: stack build

How to import the files: EXAMPLE
(Input format： Quantised midi files)

How to get the reduction analysis: EXAMPLE

How to get the fractal dimension: EXAMPLE

How to get prominent patterns: EXAMPLE

# Music Representation
Vanilla: [(TimeSignature, [[Notes]])] 
Comprehensive: [([Expression], [[Notes]])]

Music piece => Voice => Sections => Measures = list of Notes

# Reduction analysis (zooming in and out)
* Based on Local Metric
* Based on Beat Metric
* Based on Accent/Dynamics Data
* Based on Transformation
* Based on Annotation

# Fractal Dimension
Intuition: Fractal dimension measures the roughness of surfaces. As is often the case, by eyeballing sheet music, we see different degrees of roughness from different melodic lines. This roughness can be measured via how much details(mass) we "see" when we zoom in. To align with the visual intuition from sheet music representation, we use the Euclidean distance between notes as a measurement of mass.
 
Summary: To calculate the fractal dimension, we 
Zoom-in -> Calculate Mass -> Ratio between different levels of zoom-in

# DSL
This library essentially provides a DSL for analysing music.

# Musical Patterns 
Using the fractal framework, identically repeated patterns would have the same fractal dimension. However, it's a necessary condition but not a sufficient one.

Repetition at a coarser (higher) level would give the same mass at the level. 

A similar way of detailing (decorating) the music would give a similar fractal dimension.
