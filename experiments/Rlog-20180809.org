R plotting log:

!!!!!! The line segment ratios (without the problematic unit) represent compression! When the 

Promising: 
* From ij221 that the random parts corresponds to rapid changes in the time series of fractal dimension
   - different window size give different resolution
   - a change in the patterns would also affect the value
   - it becomes less obvious what are the big changes
* From ij221 to ij224, there are more bumps, it seems :TODO:
* The window sizes seem to have a smooth change between 2-4-8 when applying a sliding window

Puzzles:
* The sliding window option created a very different effect than the hopping window. 
!!!!!!!!! from looking at another example of ij224, realising that this is actually good. It represents the regularity continously in time. The hopping one represents a different discrete comparison. 
* Looking at the folkrnn results, many 0 values?

Todos:
* Put the pieces number into the right order

* generate ground truth in where are the randomness
    - how to evaluate: overlapping intervals, boundary extraction

* Measure the distance between the time series
    - plot distance matrix across the pieces, should be homogeous
    - in different experiments, there will be a distribution of the distances, or simply of the fractal dimensions, should be different

* Comparison with self similarity and kernel methods   

* More understanding on the code 
    - What notes are extracted exactly
    - look into mass
    - IMA

* Start writing paper

Done:

* earth mover's distance
